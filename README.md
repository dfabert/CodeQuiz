# CodeQuiz

This code quiz works through three parts of the HTML (splash, quiz and results).  Once the user hits the start button, a listener activates a function that moves to the 'quiz' part of the HTML.  At this point a clock in the javascript starts and a part of the Javascript places the question and the answers on the page.  On the HTML, each of the lists items that are displaying the options for answers has a "onclick" that will activate a another function.  That function will then "grade" the answer and see if the quiz can continue.  If the quiz is over (because the time is up or the questions are through) then it moves to a results page, asks for initials, and then displays the top 10 results.
